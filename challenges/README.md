# Binary Search Array
Search for a value in an array using Binary search algorithm.

## Challenge Description
search for a key value in an array, when found return its index , other wise return -1 using binary search

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach was to split the array in two halves, check if the element at the middle equals the key value, if not and bigger repeat the process for the right half. If not and smaller repeat the process for the left half. Return its index if found or -1 otherwise.
